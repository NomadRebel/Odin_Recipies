        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>2-3 medium tomatoes, pureed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Garam Masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar (to balance acidity)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water (or chicken stock)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kasuri methi(for garnish)</li>
        <li>Fresh Corriander</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken:
          <ul>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt.</li> 
            <li>Mix everything well so that the chicken is evenly coated.</li> 
            <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, but ideally for 2-3 hours (or overnight) for the best flavor.</li> 
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Cook the Chicken:
          <ul>
            <li>In a pan or grill, heat a little oil or butter and cook the marinated chicken pieces on medium-high heat until they are cooked through (about 7-10 minutes). You can also grill them if you want a smoky flavor.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove the chicken and set it aside.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Butter Chicken Gravy:
          <ul>
            <li> In the same pan, add the butter (and a little oil if needed).</li>
            <li> Once the butter melts, add the chopped onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown.</li>
            <li> Add the ginger-garlic paste and cook for another 2 minutes, until fragrant.</li>
            <li> Add the pureed tomatoes, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Stir well and cook the mixture for 5-7 minutes, allowing the tomatoes to cook down and the oil to separate.</li>
            <li> Add the sugar and mix. This helps to balance the acidity of the tomatoes and gives the gravy a nice richness.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Bring It All Together:
          <ul>
            <li>Add the cooked chicken to the gravy, and stir gently to coat the chicken with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Pour in the heavy cream and water (or chicken stock), and mix well. Simmer for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), and stir. This ingredient adds a distinctive flavor to Butter Chicken.</li>
            <li>Adjust the seasoning if needed (salt or sugar).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finish and Serve:
          <ul>
            <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
            <li>Serve the Butter Chicken hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice.</li>
          </ul>  
        </li>
      </ol>
