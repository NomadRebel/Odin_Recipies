    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

          <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
          <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
          <li>2-3 tomatoes, pureed (or 1 cup canned tomato puree)
          <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
          <li>1-2 green cardamoms</li>
          <li>1-inch cinnamon stick</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
          <li>Salt to taste</li>
          <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons butter (for garnish)</li>
          <li>Fresh coriander leaves (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cook the Dal:</strong>
          <ul>
              <li>Wash the black lentils and kidney beans thoroughly. Soak them in water for at least 6-8 hours or overnight.</li>
              <li>After soaking, drain the water and add the dal and rajma to a pressure cooker.</li>
              <li>Add about 4 cups of water and some salt. Cook on medium heat for 4-5 whistles, or until the dal and beans are soft and fully cooked. If using a pot, cook the dal and beans on low heat for 1-2 hours, adding more water as needed, until the dal is soft and creamy.</li>
              <li>Once cooked, mash the dal slightly with a spoon or the back of a ladle for a creamy texture.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li><strong>Prepare the Gravy:</strong>
          <ul>
              <li>Heat ghee and oil together in a large pan or kadhai.</li>
              <li>Add cumin seeds, cardamoms, and the cinnamon stick. Let them sizzle for a few seconds.</li>
              <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
              <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another 2-3 minutes until fragrant.</li>
              <li>Add the pureed tomatoes, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and salt. Cook the mixture on medium heat for 10-12 minutes until the oil starts separating from the masala.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Combine Dal and Gravy:</strong>
          <ul>
              <li>Once the tomato masala is cooked, add the cooked dal and kidney beans to the pan.</li>
              <li>Stir well and add about 1 cup of water (or more if you prefer a thinner consistency). Let the dal simmer on low heat for 15-20 minutes so the flavors can blend together.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Make It Creamy:</strong>
          <ul>
              <li>Add the heavy cream to the dal and stir well. This gives the dal its rich and creamy texture.</li>
              <li>Add kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves) and stir. Let it simmer for another 5-7 minutes.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong>
          <ul>
              <li>Finish off with a dollop of butter on top for that extra richness.</li>
              <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
              <li>Serve hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
  </ol>
