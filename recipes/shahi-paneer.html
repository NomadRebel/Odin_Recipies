          <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>

          <li>1/4 cup yogurt (whisked)</li>

          <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
          <li>1-2 green cardamoms</li>
          <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
          <li>4-5 cloves</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
          <li>Salt to taste</li>
          <li>Chopped fresh coriander leaves (for garnish)</li>
          <li>Saffron strands (optional, soaked in warm milk for flavor and color)</li>
          <li>Cashew nuts or almonds (optional, ground into a paste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Paneer: Cut the paneer into cubes. If you prefer soft paneer, you can soak the cubes in warm water for 10-15 minutes to soften them.</li>

<li>Prepare the Gravy:
   <ul>
    <li>Heat ghee in a pan. Add cumin seeds, cardamom, cinnamon stick, and cloves. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears.</li>
    <li>Stir in the pureed tomatoes, turmeric powder, coriander powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cook until the oil starts to separate from the masala (about 5-7 minutes).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  
<li>Make it Creamy:
  <ul>

<li>Add the whisked yogurt and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid curdling.</li>
<li>Add the milk and stir well. Let it simmer for a few minutes to form a smooth, creamy gravy.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Add Paneer and Final Spices:
<ul>
<li>Add the paneer cubes to the gravy and gently mix to coat them in the sauce.</li>
<li>Add the garam masala, fresh cream, and saffron milk (if using). Stir gently and cook for 5-7 minutes on low heat, allowing the paneer to absorb the flavors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Garnish and Serve:
<ul>
<li> Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
<li>  Serve hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    </ol>
